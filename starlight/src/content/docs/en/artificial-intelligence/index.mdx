Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to imitate human intelligence by performing tasks such as learning, problem-solving and decision-making. The development of AI has experienced three significant hype phases in the past: in the 1960s, 1980s and 2010s.

## History & development

In the 1960s, AI experienced its first heyday, fuelled by early advances in symbolic AI and the development of the first neural networks. The second hype in the 1980s was fuelled by the introduction of expert systems and improved algorithms. The most recent and significant hype to date began in the 2010s, when advances in hardware, such as more powerful and affordable GPUs, enabled the democratisation of AI. At the same time, the availability of large amounts of data (big data) meant that machine learning and deep learning in particular made enormous progress.

In recent years, the development of AI has received a further boost. Models such as ChatGPT, which has been made publicly available, demonstrate the power of modern language models that are able to generate human-like texts and answer complex queries. Today, AI is being incorporated into many fields, including healthcare, finance, education, automotive and customer service. These applications are revolutionising the way we live and work, making AI an integral part of our everyday lives.

## Areas of application

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has found a variety of application areas that are revolutionising our daily lives and various industries. From medicine to transport, AI offers solutions that increase efficiency and accuracy. Here are some of the most important application areas of AI:

- **Medicine**: Detecting diseases and assisting with diagnoses.
- **Finance**: Analysing financial markets and fraud detection.
- **Media generation**: creating texts, images and videos.
- **Facial recognition**: Security applications such as surveillance and access control.
- **Traffic**: Autonomous driving and traffic control.
- **Chatbots**: Customer service and automated communication.

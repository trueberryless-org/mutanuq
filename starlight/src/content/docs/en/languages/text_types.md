## Blog

A blog is a regularly updated website typically run by an individual or a small group. The latest entry, called a **blog post**, is usually displayed at the top of the main page. A blog is a dynamic and interactive medium; it can be updated and it allows the visitor to communicate with the author by leaving a **blog comment** attached to each individual post.

The goal of many bloggers is to provide their readers with information, to open discussions or share opinions, emotions and experiences. Man institutions and businesses also use blogs to promote their activities and products.

### Blog post

#### Characteristics

-   formal or **informal** (depending on the readership and purpose)
-   use the first-person `I` and `you`
-   use direct questions to engage the readers and invite them to leave a comment
-   devide the post in paragraphs (without headlines)

#### Layout

##### Overall information

A blog post starts with the name of the author and date of publication. Do not forget to add the current time in the same line as the date because some commenters share their opinion immediately and you want to be able to recreate the order of publications.

##### Headline

A blog post requires a **captivating title** because for most readers the decision as to whether to read the rest of your post rests upon these few first words.

> Paper books - a thing of the past?

##### Introduction

Fill the introduction with the main topic of the blog post and information which are necessary to know in order to understand the topic properly.

> It's really amazing how many people have started reading e-books recently. Even my dad - who doesn't think I need a smartphone - has decided to get one. Now he's considering getting rid of his book collection because it takes up too much space. In its place, my parents say they could put a modern wall-mounted television.

| In this post I'll share ten ways to ...              |

| Phrases                                                                              |

## Email

There are many different types of emails. You can distinguish them roughly into two types: **formal** and **informal**, with many more subtypes of formal emails, such as a job application email or a complaint email. Whether an email is formal or informal is always determined by the situation and people you write to.

### Informal email

A informal email is mostly written to friends, colleagues or other people outside the work life.

#### Characteristics

-   informal (personal)
-   use `I` and `you`
-   write about private matters (if you write to a friend)
-   use words from the language of the conversation (“Nice!”, “xD”, “OMG”, ...)
-   not necessarily about something factual or objective; more subjective topics

#### Layout

##### Overall information

Always start with the metadata, like your own email, the recipient's email, the date and a subject line.

> From: trueberryless@email.com  
> To: tom.cruise@email.com  
> Date: 20th January, 2024

> Subject: What's up?

##### Salutation

Depending on the recipient, you must write a salutation in two different ways. If the recipient is known, you can address them directly, like so:

> Dear Mr Cruise!

If the recipient is unknown, you address them indirectly, like so:

> Dear Sir or Madam!

There are also two options if it comes to punctuation after the salutation:

-   Exclamation mark: `Dear Sir or Madam!`
-   Comma: `Dear Sir or Madam,`

:::caution[Caution]
No matter whether you end the salutation with exclamation mark or comma, the first letter of the introduction must always be **UPPERCASE**.
:::

##### Introduction

Write a nice introduction where you explain why you are writing the email (kinda like a longer version of the subject line).

| Phrases                                                                            |

| I'm sorry to hear that something terrible happened. Can you tell me more about it? |

Depending on the topic or reason of the email, you should also add a personalized introduction.

##### Main part

Write the main part of the email. This can include a recent story of yours or maybe even some pictures from your recent holidays. Whatever you like, as long as it is appropriate for the topic.

##### Conclusion

Close your email with an appropriate conclusion. This means that you may sum up the main information once more or maybe ask a thought-provoking question.

> I hope that we will hear from each other again soon.

##### Close

The last element of the email is the closing.

> Best regards,  
> Felix

## Leaflet

## Report

A report sums up the main information from a presentation, a survey, a meeting or perhaps some kind of incident such as an accident. It is usually written for somebody in authority (your boss, the head of a school, ...).

### Characteristics

-   formal
-   no `I` and no `you` (Do not address the reader!)
-   no short forms (e.g. "I'm", "You'll", "He'd", ...)
-   no colloquial expressions (e.g. "Catch you later", "Hang in there", "Bite the bullet", ...)
-   use passive constructions (e.g. ~"I can say"~ "It can be said")
-   all paragraphs have subheadings

### Layout

The report is divided into sections, each with a clear subheading that explains what the paragraph is about, with the first section being the introduction.

#### General information

First write the name of the sender, the name of the recipient and the date of sending in the top left-hand corner.

> To: Stevie Wonder  
> From: Simon O'Neill  
> Date: 15 November, 2023

Then give the report a meaningful subject that briefly and succinctly summarises the topic of the report.

> Subject: Working abroad

#### Introduction

After the basic information, a short introduction is written, in which the metadata of the survey, presentation or accident are mentioned. This includes, for example, the source of the survey, when and with which participants it was carried out, and also the location of the survey if it was only carried out in one country. It is also important to mention the reason for writing the report in the first place.

> The purpose of this report is to provide an overall picture of working abroad. It is based among a survey among around 3000 students at the ages of 18 to 29 years from Germany and was conducted in 2020.
